# Github repositories issues display

If given more time I would implement the following:

1. UI improvement to the repositories area to better accommodate sorting functionality.
2. Improving the mobile logic to be more neat.
3. I would add state management library (I kept the code as short as possible).
4. Add more unit test to the code.
5. Implement more utilities functionality to use such as time manipulation.
